      <h2>1. The Least Offensive</h2>
        <p>The veggies I'd consider the least offensive are also the ones that actually give a damn. They do that work and we love them for it. When someone comes after a long day of being terrorized by the rancidness at horrendous veggies at work, the store, and wherever, they can be comforted by these OK-ish veggies. They're some of the good ones. Only kinda sorta though.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Carrots are okay, I guess. As long as they aren't boiled. They're actual mush if they are. Y'know... my ex-boyfriend was the first to tell me there was a such thing as carrot juice. When I found out he actually enjoyed that ca-ca. Immediate ick. I GTFO.</p></ul>
